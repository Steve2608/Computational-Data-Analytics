> *The submission should be in the form of a self-explanatory presentation (e.g. PDF, OpenOffice or PowerPoint) with a focus on interpretation or analysis.*

## 1 Rule Learning: Application and Interpretation (2 P.)

> *In this exercise you will compare JRip, JRip without pruning (by setting usePruning=False) and ConjunctiveRule on different datasets. Therefore, choose ten datasets and try to have as much variance in the number of instances, the number of attributes and the attribute data types as possible.*

> *1. Compare the number of rules, conditions and predicted classes of the resulting rule sets with respect to:*
> - *the datasets*
> - *the rule classifiers*

> *2. Is there a default rule for all algorithms? If so:*
> - *Which class is usually chosen as default rule?*
> - *How do you interpret the quality of the default rule?*

> *3. On the basis of the previous subtasks, can you make a statement which of the datasets is the easiest or best to learn?*

> *4. Perform a Friedman-Nemenyi test on the results and check whether there is a significant difference between the performance of the classifiers.*
